# Introduction
For this first part of the project is the goal to make an automatically running programm in a Virtual Machine, that host an API-fetching and database-writing system, with informations displayed in a webbased-UI.

# Installation and Configuration

## Steps Taken

1. A virtual machine was prepared with Ubuntu 25.10 environment.
2. Required Python standard libraries were used (requests, sqlite3, xml).
4. A SOAP client class was implemented to communicate with the OpenTransportData API.
5. A Datex Paser class was created to make the records "ready-to-work".
6. A periodic collector class binds the Soap Client and Datex Parser was implemented to coordinate their actions.
7. A database-handling class can create, read and write databases.
8. A main program offering a CLI to try the previous actions and serve debugging is created, we consider this as a milestone.
9. Methodes of the previous functions are called to run a in a Webbased-UI.

## Effect

After installation and configuration:
- The system can fetch live traffic data every minute.
- New measurements are stored automatically without duplicates.
- The database persists data across restarts.
- The program can read the database and display informations on the webbased-UI.

# Web Dashboard Access

## Accessing the Dashboard

The dashboard is accessed through a web browser.

1. Start the web UI service.
2. Open a browser.
3. Navigate to:

http://

The dashboard connects to the SQLite database generated by the collector
and displays live and historical traffic measurements.

# Starting the System

Run the virtual Machine.
Hosting and fetching starts automatically.
Warning: No background service remains running after shutting down the virtual machine.
