# SwissSpeed

The goal of this project is to create a VM, that is automatically fetching data with API, storing it in a database, and showing it in a dashboard on a web server.
To this end, we are using VMware Workstation, Ubuntu and SQLite. The programs are written in Python.
The data we are fetching comes from opentransportdata.swiss and represent measurements of car's speed in fix locations.
