# SwissSpeed

SwissSpeed is a programming project undertaken as part of a Distributed Computing class in our studies.
It comprises two parts with precisely defined goals. The approach we took to achieve these goals is documented in more detail in the links.

## Part 1

The goal of this part is to create a Virtual Machine, that is automatically fetching data with API, storing it in a database, and showing it in a dashboard on a web server.
To this end, we are using VMware Workstation, Ubuntu and SQLite. The programs are written in Python.
The data we are fetching comes from opentransportdata.swiss and represent measurements of car's speed in fix locations.
