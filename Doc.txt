
creation new VM with VMware Workstation: Ubuntu 25.10


In a new terminal:

-> snap install sqLitebrowser
-> sudo apt install python3 requests

-> touch FetchSwissSpeed.py
-> Nano, test code to see if the connection work
-> python3 FetchSwissData: problems with "Access to this API has been disallowed"
   -> Hash and token were false, corrections and test code working.


Making a new SQLite Database for first tests.

CREATE TABLE "SwissSpeed" (
	"id"	INTEGER,
	"plate"	INTEGER,
	"location"	INTEGER,
	"speed"	INTEGER
);

New Python file: WriteData.py
testing code to see how a python code can write the database.

Rebuild of the structure
More OO with more separations
Four files:
- SOAPClient fetches data from the API
- DatexParser transforms XML into usable data 
- DBHandler creates, writes and is in charge of everything that has to do with the databases
- Main coordinate the actions

Update
Now the actions are coordinate by a new class "Collector"
Main is in charge of a simple UI working in the console.
